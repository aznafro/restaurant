# Restaurant Page

This is the Restaurant Page for one of The Odin Project's Javascript projects. This site focuses on serving tabbed data from Javascript modules. 

Note: With the way the Menu tab is set up, if you want to change from mobile view to desktop or vise versa, you should refresh the page after resizing the window.

The live site can be seen [here](https://aznafro.github.io/restaurant/).
